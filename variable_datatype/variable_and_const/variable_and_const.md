# 1.DataTypes

- effect: Tell the compiler how much space should be assigned to certain data

1. Const: data that can not be changed during run time
   - const int: 1   200
   - const char: 'a'
   - string const: 'hello'
   - float const: 3.14

2. Variable: data that can be changed during run time, saved in memory
   - need to be defined 
   - allocate space in memory, tell compiler the space(announce)

   ```c++
      datatype name
      int a;
   ```

   int      4
   short    2
   long     windows:4 Linux32:4  Linux64:8
   char     1
   float    4
   double   8

   Example:
   ```c++
      int a;
      double b;
   ```

define: allocate space in memory

initiate: allocate space and give value

claim: 'extern int a' announce without allocating space
