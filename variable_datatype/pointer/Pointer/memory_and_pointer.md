# Memory and Pointer

## concept
address: memory id

    this id is called pointer

## Pointer variable

    varibale for saving pointer(address)
the address is like  0x0000 0000, so the size of the pointer is 4 bytes

for 64 compilers, address is like 0x0000 0000 0000 0000, so the size is 8 bytes

**How to define a pointer**
```c++
int a=10;

int* p;
p=&a;

int*p=&a;

```
